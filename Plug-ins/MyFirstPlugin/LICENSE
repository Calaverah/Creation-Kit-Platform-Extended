This a test project, and serves as a guide for creating plugins.
 
You can also use the assets of this test project, some platform classes are passed with their interfaces 
without implementation, so that they can be used inside the plugin, while you will not necessarily need 
to open the code to the public. But you cannot use CKPE assets, in which case you must disclose 
the code and indicate authorship. And also you can't re-license, only GPLv3.
