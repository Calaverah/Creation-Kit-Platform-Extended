  A collection of modifications, enhancements, and reverse engineered resources for Creation Kit by Bethesda.

# Description
**The mod is in the early stages of development.** The platform will support all known versions of Creation Kit in the future, but the focus is first on the Creation Kit version SSE 1.6.1130. This is a continuation of two previously arhived projects, as I am already confused in the code. The new implementation is based on the principle of modularity, which will allow for better control of development.
