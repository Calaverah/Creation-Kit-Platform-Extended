# Description
The powerful open-source platform makes numerous fixes and improvements to the **Creation Kit** editor from **Bethesda**. This is a continuation of two previously archived projects, as I am already confused in the code. The new implementation is based on the principle of modularity, which will allow for better control of development.  

> [!NOTE]
> At the moment, the platform supports **CK** version:
> | Skyrim | Fallout 4 |
> | ------------- | ------------- |
> | **SSE 1.5.3.0** | **F4 1.10.162.0** |
> | **SSE 1.5.73.0** | **F4 1.10.943.1** |
> | **SSE 1.6.438.0**  |  |
> | **SSE 1.6.1130.0** |  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CK** does not work well with **ENB**.  
> I wrote **ckpe_loader**. This is console app, for 15 seconds renames from the known to me .dll files that harm the work of CK this time is enough to load the CK itself. All renames .dll files will be restored name after this time.

> [!NOTE]
> You can remove *Steam* from the **Creation Kit**.  
> You just need to manually replace the string *`steam_api64.dll`* on *`winhttp.dll`* in any **HEX editor**. Since the new string is four bytes shorter, the remaining bytes are set to **`0x00`**. Or compile the **NoSteam Patcher** in **Lazarus** and use it.  
> For versions **`1.6.438.0`** and **`1.10.162.0`**, you first need to remove **`Steam DRM`**, for example, [Steamless](https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless).

# Mod Settings
To hide errors, create a file *CreationKitPlatformExtendedMessagesBlacklist.txt*.  
**IMPORTANT**: Errors should be copied from the mod's Log window and one error is one line. The file must be in **ANSI** encoding.  
*CreationKitPlatformExtended.ini* the main file with the settings and comes with the code, be sure to read.

# Unicode
**`ONLY SURROGATE`**: Support for English and native languages without special characters.
For understanding, the application uses the ancient **`ANSI`** type string representation. The idea is to feed the text already in your native encoding. When loading `.esp`, `.esl`, `.esm` files all strings are translated from **`UTF-8`** to **`WinCP`**, and when saved back. **`WinCP`** is the current encoding in your operating system.  

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> In **`Win10`**, in the language settings, there is now an option to work with **`UTF-8`**, you need to turn it off otherwise there will be only **`?`**.

Take .dll's from the **`x64`** folder also take all **`VoltekLib.XXXX.dll`**, from the **`x64/Release`** and move it to the folder with the game. 
Take the database **`CreationKitPlatformExtended_<GAME>_1_X_XXXX.database`** from the folder **`Database/<GAME>/1_X_XXXX/`**. 
You will also need **`Stuffs/<GAME>/CreationKitPlatformExtendedMessagesBlacklist.txt`** and **`Stuffs/<GAME>/CreationKitPlatformExtended.ini`** to the game folder.
